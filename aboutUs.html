        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            At the heart of Berkshire Hathaway’s success lies a disciplined investment philosophy: we invest in companies we believe in. Warren Buffett’s approach to focusing on "evergreen" businesses—those with enduring value and consistent returns—has shaped Berkshire into the financial powerhouse it is today. We seek businesses that align with our principles of integrity, simplicity, and long-term sustainability. By avoiding industries that require speculative decision-making, we ensure our portfolio remains robust and reliable, even in uncertain times.
            <br><br>
            We pride ourselves on being a company for the long term. Our class A shares reflect this commitment to longevity, boasting the highest per-share price in the world due to our historical opposition to stock splits. This reflects not just the value of our business but also the trust placed in us by our investors, employees, and partners.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Our Global Impact</h3>
        <p>
            As one of the largest companies in the world, Berkshire Hathaway is ranked 5th on the Fortune 500 and 9th on the Fortune Global 500. Our influence extends beyond financial markets, as we are also one of the largest employers in the United States. In August 2024, we became the first non-technology company to surpass $1 trillion in market capitalization, a testament to our enduring success and prudent leadership.
            <br><br>
            Despite our global reach, our core values remain the same. At Berkshire Hathaway, we are committed to fostering growth, creating opportunities, and delivering value—not just for our shareholders but for all stakeholders. We are proud to be a company that blends tradition with innovation and stability with progress, all while maintaining the highest standards of excellence.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn about us. We invite you to explore more about the businesses and people who make up the Berkshire Hathaway family. Together, we are building a brighter future, one step at a time.
