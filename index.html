        <h3>Welcome to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</h3>
        <p>
            Berkshire Hathaway Inc., headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, is proud to be a cornerstone of American business and a symbol of enduring success. With a rich history dating back to 1839 as a textile manufacturer, Berkshire Hathaway has grown into a global powerhouse under the visionary leadership of Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger. Today, Greg Abel continues the tradition of exceptional leadership, ensuring our legacy of stability and growth for years to come.
            <br><br>
            At Berkshire Hathaway, we are committed to delivering consistent, long-term value to our shareholders.

Our disciplined approach to investing in evergreen businesses with predictable returns is the cornerstone of our philosophy. This unwavering focus has earned us a place among the largest and most respected corporations in the world, recently reaching a historic milestone as the first non-technology company in the U.S. to surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization.
